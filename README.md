# AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance Solution

## Overview
This project is part of a hackathon where we're developing a predictive maintenance solution utilizing various AI agents. The goal is to detect anomalies, predict equipment failures, and recommend maintenance actions to reduce operational costs and improve efficiency.

## Repository Structure
- `docs/`: Would contain all documentation related to the project.
- `src/`: Contains the source code for all agents and common utilities.
- `tests/`:Would contain unit and integration tests for the solution.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies.
3. Run the agents as needed using the scripts provided in the `src/` folder.

## Usage
To train the anomaly detection model, navigate to the `src/anomaly_detection_agent/` directory and run:
```bash
python train_anomaly_model.py
